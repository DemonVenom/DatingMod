# Minecraft Dating Mod

## About

I was forced against my will to make this for my friends.

For those unaware,
the [Roblox Girlfriend Meme](https://imgflip.com/tag/roblox+girlfriend) is an Internet Meme
spawned as a way to satirize the act of young persons seeking out romantic relationships through online video games.

This mod takes inspiration from the spirit of that meme, but for a similar video game targeted at young children. 
It is now possible to develop parasocial relationships with male and female entities within Minecraft. 
This is done through "dates" that users can initiate with the male and female entities.
Use the [lead](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lead) item to go on walks with your boyfriend/girlfriend.
Every entity has their own name, so none are the same. Up to 300 possible name possibilities!

In conclusion your honor, it was done purely for the bit.

## Setup

For those new to Minecraft Modding using Fabric API (as opposed to Forge API), you must first install Fabric to your PC.

You **MUST** use the Fabric API for Minecraft version 1.16.5 or lower and OpenJDK 8.

This is because the mod does not currently support
Minecraft version 1.17 and up. Downloading Fabric API version 1.16 can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files)
and scroll down to Recent Files, find a Fabric API version that supports "Game Version" 1.16.5 or lower. To download or verify if Java OpenJDK 8 is
already installed go here: [Windows](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:java:windows),
[Linux](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:java:linux), [macOS](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:java:mac)

A good tutorial for doing so can be found [here](https://shockbyte.com/billing/knowledgebase/212/How-to-install-FabricMC-on-your-PC.html)
After installing the Fabric API, follow the tutorial [here](https://shockbyte.com/billing/knowledgebase/213/How-to-install-Fabric-Mods-on-your-PC.html)
to install Fabric Mods to your PC. **BOTH** dating-mod **AND** fabric-api JAR files must be placed into your mods folder.

Boot up Minecraft Launcher, select fabric-loader-1.16.5 (to the left of the green PLAY button), and the Minecraft Dating Mod should be installed!


For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup)
that relates to the IDE that you are using.
